          Neopremia is a brand division of Mark SG Enterprises Ltd. We are
          specialist manufacturers of bespoke products made from neoprene
          synthetic rubber materials. Neopremia is not a promotional merchandise
          agent; we are your direct source for design and manufacture in
          neoprene material. We{"'"}ve been active in the neoprene rubber
          business for over 25 years, having originally worked in wetsuit
          design, development and production. We offer our trade customers a
          significant market advantage as a direct result of our expertise in
          materials and assembly together with our supply-chain structure which
          has been in place for over 20 years. We offer quick lead times,
          competitive pricing and excellent support services for sourcing
          companies across the globe. We manage orders into the UK, Europe and
          for an increasing number of US customers.

          Sourcing your products directly from Asia can be a risky business.
          Through Neopremia, you can rest assured that our history, our factory
          investments and partnerships offer you complete assurance in quality
          control, delivery schedules and print finishing.
        </p>
        <p className="text-white text-sm font-light leading-5 pb-2">
          Product design and development is a principal part of our business
          offer - a thorough knowledge of capabilities and limitations in both
          materials and construction, Neopremia can manufacture almost anything
          in neoprene rubber material.
